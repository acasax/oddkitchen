                <h2 class="pptHeader2">Your rights</h2>
                <p class="pptText">
                    The ODD Kitchen respects your privacy and wants you to have control over how your
                    personal information is used. Subject to local law, here are ways in which you can
                    control your personal information: <br>
                    - You may revoke your consent to the collection and use of your personal<br>
                    information at any time.<br>
                    - You can request us to erase or block the use of your personal information<br>
                    - You can inform us of any changes to your personal information or have us
                    correct any information we have about you<br>
                    - The exercise of your rights is free of charge <br>
                </p>
                <h2 class="pptHeader2">Limitations of liability</h2>
                <p class="pptText">
                    In no event shall we or any of our providers be liable to any person for damages of any
                    kind, under any legal theory, including, but not limited to, any direct, indirect, special,
                    consequential, punitive, or other damages resulting from your use of or inability to use
                    the online services and materials, programs, features, and services made available
                    through the online services, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such
                    damages. Because some states do not permit the exclusion or limitation of certain
                    damages, in such jurisdictions, liability is limited to the fullest extent permitted by such
                    state law.
                </p>
                <h2 class="pptHeader2">Dispute resolution, arbitration clause and class action waiver</h2>
                <p class="pptText">
                    Our hope is to resolve any issue you may have with the services before needing a
                    formal legal case. You agree that if you have a dispute with The ODD Kitchen arising
                    from, connected to, or in any way related to these terms, you will try and resolve the
                    dispute first by contacting The ODD Kitchen customer service at
                    contact@theoddkitchen.com
                </p>
                <p class="pptText">
                    You agree that you will not take any legal action, including filing a lawsuit or demanding
                    arbitration, until 20 business days after you've sent a message. If the disagreement
                    stated in the message is not resolved to your satisfaction within 10 business days after
                    it is received, and you intend on taking legal action, you agree that you will file a
                    demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA” or “the
                    “Arbitrator”). You agree that disputes between you and The ODD Kitchen relating to
                    these services will be resolved by binding arbitration. This arbitration provision limits the
                    ability of you and The ODD Kitchen to litigate claims in court and you and The ODD
                    Kitchen each agree to waive your respective rights to a jury trial or a state or federal
                    judge. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is
                    limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and
                    relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages) and
                    must follow these terms.
                </p>
                <h2 class="pptHeader2">Arbitration will be held in New York, NY</h2>
                <p class="pptText">
                    You agree that you will not file any lawsuit against The ODD Kitchen in any state or
                    federal court. You agree that if you do sue in state or federal court, and The ODD
                    Kitchen brings a successful motion to compel arbitration, you must pay all fees and
                    costs incurred by The ODD Kitchen in court, including reasonable attorney's fees. You
                    and The ODD Kitchen agree that any judicial proceeding will be brought in the Federal
                    or State courts of New York, NY. For any such filing of a demand for arbitration, you
                    must affect proper service under the rules of the arbitrator and notice to the Notice
                    Address may not be sufficient. If, for any reason, the American Arbitration Association is
                    unable to conduct the arbitration, you may file your case with any national arbitration
                    company. You agree that the arbitrator will have sole and exclusive jurisdiction over any
                    dispute you have with The ODD Kitchen. The Federal Arbitration Act allows for the
                    enforcement of arbitration agreements and governs the interpretation and enforcement
                    of the agreement to arbitrate. You agree that you will not file a class action or collective
                    action against The ODD Kitchen, and that you will not participate in a class action or
                    collective action against them. You agree that you will not join your claims to those of
                    any other person. Notwithstanding any other provision in these terms, if this class action
                    waiver is invalidated, then the agreement to arbitrate is null and void, as though it were
                    never entered into, and any arbitration dispute at that time will be dismissed without
                    prejudice and may be re-filed in a court. Under no circumstances do you or The ODD
                    Kitchen agree to class or collective procedures in arbitration or the joinder of claims in
                    arbitration. The ODD Kitchen agrees that we will submit all disputes with you to
                    arbitration before the Arbitrator.
                </p>
                <h2 class="pptHeader2">Miscellaneous</h2>
                <p class="pptText">
                    These terms constitute the entire agreement between you and The ODD Kitchen. They
                    govern your use of the services and supersede all previous written or oral agreements
                    between you and The ODD Kitchen with respect to the services. These Terms will be
                    governed by the laws of the State of New York, U.S.A., notwithstanding any conflicts of
                    laws principles. The failure of The ODD Kitchen to enforce a provision is not a waiver of
                    its right to do so later. No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall
                    be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. If a
                    provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the terms will remain in full
                    force and effect. You may not assign any of your rights under these terms, and any
                    such attempt will be void. The ODD Kitchen may assign its rights to any successor in
                    interest of any business associated with the services. Nothing contained in this
                    agreement shall create any association, partnership, or agency or joint venture between
                    The ODD Kitchen and You.
                </p>
                <p class="pptText">
                    The failure of The ODD Kitchen to comply with these terms because of an act of God,
                    war, fire, riot, terrorism, actions of federal, state, or local governmental authorities, or for
                    any other reason beyond the reasonable control of The ODD Kitchen shall not be
                    deemed a breach of this agreement.
